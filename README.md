# ERC-20 Token Contract

This repository contains an ERC-20 token contract with minting, transfer, and burn functionalities, created using Solidity and OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 standard.

## Features
- **Mint**: The contract owner can mint new tokens.
- **Transfer**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Burn**: Token holders can burn tokens they own.

## How to Use
1. Deploy the contract on an Ethereum network (e.g., testnet).
2. Use the `mint()` function to mint tokens to any address.
3. Transfer tokens with `transfer()`.
4. Burn tokens with `burn()`.

## Contract Code
The Solidity code can be found in the `MyToken.sol` file.
